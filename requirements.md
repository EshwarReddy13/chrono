# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a time tracking application similar to Clockify. The application will allow users to track time spent on different projects using a stopwatch interface, view detailed time reports across various periods, and receive AI-driven insights about their work patterns. The application will be developed as a cross-platform solution supporting web browsers, desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), and mobile devices (iOS, Android).
